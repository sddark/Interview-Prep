# My Roadmap

Week 1: Language basics

Weeks 2 & 3: Understand use cases, benefits, draw backs, of data structures, algorithms, patterns, and big O notation (space and time)

Weeks 4 & 5: Practice easy ranked data structures, algorithms, and patterns

Weeks 6 - 8: Practice medium to hard ranked data structures, algorithms, and patterns. Perform mock interviews. 

Week 9: Review System Design 

Week 10: Learn SQL basics

Week 11: Review API basics and Multithreading

Week 12: Review Object Oriented Design
