Hash Map is O(1) time complexity on average and O(n) in space.

Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.

A hash function performs hashing by turning any data into a fixed-size sequence of bytes called the hash value or the hash code. Itâ€™s a number that can act as a digital fingerprint or a digest, usually much smaller than the original data, which lets you verify its integrity.

Python dictionaries are a hash map.
