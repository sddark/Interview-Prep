### User Input
---
Python allows for user input.

That means we are able to ask the user for input.

Python 3.6 uses the input() method.

The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:

`username = input("Enter username:")`

`print("Username is: " + username)`

Note: Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, and continues when the user has given some input.
